We are going to learn more about css. CSS will help us to make our website more attractive so that it will be repsonsible to the users.

As we know HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to create the actual content of the page, such as written text, and CSS (Cascade Styling Sheets) is responsible for the design or style of the website, including the layout, visual effects and background color.

CSS is a style sheet or presentational language that is used to layout, format, and style documents that are written in HTML to make them look beautiful. CSS is generally used with HTML to change the style of web pages and user interfaces. You can use CSS to change the color, backgrounds, borders, paddings, margins, fonts, icons, position and various other properties of HTML elements in a web document.

Let take a small example of how we can add a css on a paragraph :

p
{
color:red;
}
The p here represents tag paragraph .This means the font color of paragraph will change to red!!

There are three types of CSS which are given below:

Inline CSS
Internal or Embedded CSS
External CSS

Inline CSS: Inline CSS contains the CSS property in the body section attached to the element is known as inline CSS. This kind of style is specified within an HTML tag using the style attribute.

Internal or Embedded CSS: This can be used when a single HTML document must be styled uniquely. The CSS rule set should be within the HTML file in the head section i.e. the CSS is embedded within the <style> tag inside the head section of the HTML file.
External CSS: External CSS contains separate CSS files that contain only style properties with the help of tag attributes (For example class, id, heading, â€¦ etc). CSS property is written in a separate file with a .css extension and should be linked to the HTML document using a link tag.
