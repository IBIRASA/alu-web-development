We are going to learn more about css. CSS will help us to make our website more attractive so that it will be repsonsible to the users.

As we know HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to create the actual content of the page, such as written text, and CSS (Cascade Styling Sheets) is responsible for the design or style of the website, including the layout, visual effects and background color.

CSS is a style sheet or presentational language that is used to layout, format, and style documents that are written in HTML to make them look beautiful. CSS is generally used with HTML to change the style of web pages and user interfaces. You can use CSS to change the color, backgrounds, borders, paddings, margins, fonts, icons, position and various other properties of HTML elements in a web document.

Let take a small example of how we can add a css on a paragraph :

p
{
color:red;
}
The p here represents tag paragraph .This means the font color of paragraph will change to red!!
